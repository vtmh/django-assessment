Make a login app using Django's Auth that consists of a custom user model named "CustomUser".

Focus on the design of the login interface -- Style and Design is important!

Tech:
- use SQLite for the DB
- use any CSS framework you want, we use Bootstrap 4 in production though.
- jQuery or plain JS fine

Requirements:

- User Registration
- Login Interface
    - Once User Accesses System Allow them to Edit Account.
- 2FA based on Email.
    - console out the email, it doesn't have to run through SMTP as it costs money, but it should be production ready if wanted.
 
Optional
Docker
SMS 2FA
Celery for Async Tasks
